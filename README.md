## ðŸ’§ Water Potability Prediction: 

This project predicts whether water is *safe for human consumption (potable)* based on its chemical properties.  
It uses *Machine Learning models* to classify water samples as *potable (1)* or *not potable (0)*.  

## Key objectives:  
- Analyze water quality parameters like *pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity*.  
- Train and evaluate ML models for classification.  
- Provide data visualizations to understand the distribution of water quality indicators.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- *Name*: [Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)  
- *Features*: 9 chemical attributes of water  
- *Target*:  
  - 1 â†’ Potable (safe for drinking)  
  - 0 â†’ Not Potable (unsafe)  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- *Python 3.10+*  
- *Pandas, NumPy* â€“ Data handling  
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn* â€“ Data visualization  
- *Scikit-learn* â€“ Machine Learning models  
- *Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab* â€“ Development  

## âš™ Project Workflow  
1. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize / scale features  

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Histograms, bar charts, correlation heatmaps  

3. *Model Building*  
   - Train/Test Split  
   - Random Forest Classifier (baseline model)  
   - Compare with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  

4. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report
